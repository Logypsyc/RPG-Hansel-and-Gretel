The woman complains about how there is not enough food for the whole family and offers a solution in the form of abandoning the kids. You feel your sister tense up, so you put your hand on her shoulder. Gretel calms down and relaxes at your touch, but not for long. The woman then goes on to describe the plan of abandoning you and your sister in the woods, far from the home. Gretel begins to tremble greatly, but you hold some optimism in your heart.

Both you and your sister obey their command, and sat down where they had stopped. The parents then left the children behind.

When I got there, I heard Stepmother talk of a plan to abandon me and my big brother in the woods. That scared me a lot, because there are many beasts and dangerous things deep in the woods.

I think Hansel tried to make a trail of crumbs, so that once Daddy and Stepmother left us behind, we could follow this trail back to our house. But I don’t think this is a good idea, as there are many birds in the forest. I wanted to tell Brother Hansel that his plan wasn’t going to work, but he was too focused on what he was doing. Finally, both Daddy and Stepmother stopped. We were very deep in the forest. They then said that they had to go collect wood, and that Hansel and I should stay put right there. My brother and I Brother did what they said and we sat down there. While we sat down, we ate the bread that I had saved for later. Thirty minutes later, Hansel said we should go home now, so he got up and pulled me up along with him. We then tried to look for the breadcrumbs that Hansel left, but we couldn’t find them.
