Although you are wary of magic after your encounter with the witch, you instinctively feel that you could trust the golden goose. It tells you that it, truly, isn’t here to hurt you or Gretel. The goose also says that it will help you get as close to your house as possible. Your sister looks to you to see if the both of you should really accept the goose’s offer. You debate the issue for a bit, but just like the witch’s offer, you accept it in the end. After all, the both of you are very helpless at the moment. The goose then tells the both of you to come closer, otherwise it couldn’t move the both of you to where you needed to be. You and Gretel comply with the golden goose’s request. When you do so, a golden light comes from above, surrounds you, your sister, and the goose." + pause)

Even if Hansel wanted me to live, I still didn’t feel good. Then, from nowhere, a golden goose flew down to where I was. It asked me why I was crying, and I told it that my brother just died. Even though the goose was suspicious, I was very sad at the time, so I didn’t think about that. The goose then told me that it could help me go home. I took its offer without thinking, because again, I was very sad and I wasn’t thinking straight.

He really was dead, wasn’t he? After some time, I got back up and ventured back into the forest." + pause)
